# Global Radio & Podcast Platform — Bun migration ⚡

This repository has been updated to use Bun as the package manager.

Quickstart

- Install Bun: https://bun.sh
- From repository root:
  - Run `bun install` or `./setup.sh` (the setup script also installs frontend/backend deps)

Useful commands

- `bun run install` — install backend and frontend deps (root `package.json` script)
- `bun run dev:backend` — start the backend development server
- `bun run dev:frontend` — start the frontend dev server
- `bun run dev` — run both dev servers (shell-based helper)

Notes

- Existing `package-lock.json` files were removed in favor of Bun's `bun.lockb` file (generated by `bun install`). Commit the resulting `bun.lockb` after running `bun install`.
- Docker setup and `setup.sh` are Bun-aware and install dependencies using `bun install`.

If you want these changes adjusted or prefer a different Bun version, say so and I can update it. 🎯
